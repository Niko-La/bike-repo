## Executive Summary

We have developed a cutting-edge electric two-wheeler platform that seamlessly integrates with smart city infrastructure while performing as a heavy-duty work bike. 

Our platform features:
- Advanced embedded electronics
- Custom-designed speed traction controller
- High-Performance Electronic dual motors
- RISC-V Linux infotainment SBC
- RISC-V Custom core AI Board
- Over 20 MEMS Sensors for unprecedented safety & IoT
- Vehicle-to-Anything Battery Power Inverters
- Next-generation alloys and carbon fiber construction

All components are designed, manufactured, and tested in-house, with rapid assembly and a fully vertically integrated supply chain.
High-Performance parts including 6-piston brakes, quad suspension, and lighting systems are sourced from premium European & Taiwanese Supply Partners.

We are transitioning from research to small-scale production, aiming to scale our technology and demonstrate real-world applications. 
Our Small Scale Batch production is designed to establish a B2B vertical and gather crucial data for training our AI Software stack.
We have allocated a portion of our production capacity for Friends & Family and Enthusiasts, allowing for personal development and real-world testing at our discretion.

We are actively seeking strategic partners, collaborators, and investors to help bring our electronic platform to market and increase its visibility.
